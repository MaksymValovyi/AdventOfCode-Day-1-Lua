# Advent of Code 2024 Day-1 in Lua

This repository contains two files for each part of a task and file which has functions for both parts.

`` day1_1.lua `` This is for the first part of the task.

`` day1_2.lua `` This is for the second part of the task.

`` func_d1_1.lua `` Function file.

To complete your task you need to copy your puzzle input and write it to the **input.txt** file

## Small Remark

Is this code shite? 

-> Yes.

Does this code work? 

-> Yes.

What should I do with this?

-> Don't take it deep into my heart, small steps each day.

## Feel free to use this code and improve it. My first public git repo, so I'm open to any suggestions.
